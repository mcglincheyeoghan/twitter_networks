# twitter_networks
This was the second assignment I did for the module Network Analysis. In this assignment, I created follower, reply, mention,
user hashtag, and hashtag co-occurrance networks for University Twitter accounts and their tweets. The code I used for this
assignment can be viewed in the 18300093_Assignment2.ipynb file. In this file, you will be able to view the various networks
I have created, including some bi-partite networks and ego netoworks for various users and hashtags.
